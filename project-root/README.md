# User story
As an RPG player, I want to store different types of items in my inventory (swords, potions, maps) so I can use them in the game based on their unique attributes and enhance my gameplay experience.

*Student Pledge* I certify that I have used AI tools (ChatGPT/Gemini) as a mentor to explain concepts and debug errors, not as a replacement for my logic. I have manually validated every line of code committed here. I understand that 'Copy-Pasting' without understanding is academic dishonesty.
