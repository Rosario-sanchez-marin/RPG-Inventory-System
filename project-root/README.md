# RPG-Inventory-System
*Project Description* Why NoSQL: An "Item" can be a sword (has damage, durability), a potion (has an effect, duration), or a map (has coordinates). Ideal flexible schema. Challenge: Arrays of objects within the player's inventory.


*Student Pledge* I certify that I have used AI tools (ChatGPT/Gemini) as a mentor to explain concepts and debug errors, not as a replacement for my logic. I have manually validated every line of code committed here. I understand that 'Copy-Pasting' without understanding is academic dishonesty.
